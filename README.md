# gcp_model_deploy

## Deploy a tf.keras Model to Google Cloud Platform


### Requirements

  1. Docker
  2. Google Cloud SDK
  

Using Makefile you can test your model locally (use make serving-local) or on GCP (use make serving-gcp).


If you want to use your own model instead of cats, its just to change MODEL_NAME in make file and Dockerfile.


Enjoy it !!!
